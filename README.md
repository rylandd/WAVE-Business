# Wave-Business

The **WAVE - For Business Owners** project is being developed in order to help improve the nightlife at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
It does just that by allowing business owners to see their projected customers, create ads, check ad performance, and understand what connects the best with their customers.
