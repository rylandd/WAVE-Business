# Wave-Business

The **WAVE - For Business Owners** project is being developed in order to help improve the nightlife at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
It does just that by allowing business owners to see their projected customers, create ads, check ad performance, and understand what connects the best with their customers.

  + Running locally: In order to run the mobile application locally, you can build the app for any type of mobile Apple device, such as iPhone, iPod, or iPad. Once you do that, you just click the play button in the top left corner of the Xcode window and it should create an emulator of the device selected at the top and present the app as if it was installed on the device.
